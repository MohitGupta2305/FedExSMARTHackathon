RAG-Powered Multi-Agent System for Intelligent Debt Recovery

This repository contains the implementation of an Autonomous Revenue Integrity Framework designed to modernize legacy debt recovery operations using a state-of-the-art Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agent ecosystem.

The system replaces manual, fragmented workflows with AI-driven prioritization, governance, and explainability, enabling transparent, scalable, and self-optimizing debt recovery.
Problem Statement

Traditional debt recovery processes suffer from:

Manual & fragmented operations
Case allocation and tracking spread across emails and spreadsheets

Opaque feedback loops
Limited real-time visibility between enterprise systems and DCAs

Governance vacuum
Weak audit trails, unclear ownership, inconsistent SLA enforcement

Data silos
Analytics locked in legacy ERPs, preventing predictive decision-making

These challenges lead to high operational overhead, revenue leakage, and poor accountability.

Solution Architecture

This project implements a RAG-based autonomous agent framework that bridges legacy ERPs and modern AI systems using RPA + LLM intelligence.

Core Capabilities

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for contextual reasoning

Autonomous orchestration across agents

Three-tier intelligence (tactical → supervisory → strategic)

Explainable, audit-ready decision flows

Secure, role-based DCA collaboration

RAG Agent Ecosystem
Agent-1: The Allocator

Purpose: Intelligent case allocation & prioritization

Key Functions:

Synthesizes 15+ variables (PTP, CTR, utilization) into a Match Score

Replaces static assignment with dynamic resource loading

Eliminates manual Excel tracking

Enforces 100% SLA ownership from Day 1

Agent-2: The Auditor

Purpose: Compliance, sentiment & dispute intelligence

Key Functions:

Converts ERP logs into structured compliance scores using NLP

Identifies financial hardship vs service-level disputes

Centralizes DCA feedback into a single source of truth

Builds audit-ready logs for regulatory review

Agent-3: The Strategist

Purpose: Portfolio-level optimization & forecasting

Key Functions:

Aggregates multi-agent outputs into predictive cash forecasts

Uses natural language querying to analyze portfolio trends

Simulates recovery strategies under volatility

Enables proactive, data-driven interventions
